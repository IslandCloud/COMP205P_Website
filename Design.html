                <h2>System Architecture</h2>

                <p>
                    The system is comprised of three major components. The REST API, the Chart Engine and the Set
                    Engine.
                    Additionally there are several important subcomponents including general purpose Readers, Writers
                    and a number of helper classes to help facilitate the running of each major component. Data is
                    stored in a blob on Azure.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>The Set Engine<br><br>This program generates sets and writes the sets to the Azure blob. The
                            Set
                            Engine does not need to know the structure of the database in order to generates the sets
                            but splits
                            tables into columns and generates sets based on the column data. The Set Engine should be
                            run
                            automatically a weekly basis using the Windows Task Scheduler to ensure data on the blob is
                            up to date.
                            After
                            every run of the Set Engine results are emailed to whomever the user desires.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The Chart Engine<br><br>The Chart Engine is a general purpose program for generating charts.
                            The idea originally came from the fact that Team 1 were generating the charts based on our
                            data. This can be very slow as we will need to send many sets to Team 1 in order for them to
                            generate charts. If we instead move the Chart Engine to the backend then the charts can be
                            generated much faster because no sets will be required to be sent to the frontend which can
                            be
                            very slow depending on the size of the set.</p>

                        <p>The REST API<br><br>The REST API... </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Supporting Libraries<br><br>During the development of the three programs above we developed
                            several libraries that were regularly used throughout the course of the project. The Blob
                            Reader and Writer classes were the main classes that were used most extensively. Some
                            additional important libraries include a Graph Retriever that is used to link the REST API
                            to the Chart Engine, a database generation tool that we created to generate sample databases
                            and a simple decision tree that we used to classify data types which was needed for the Set
                            Engine.</p>
                    </li>

                    <!--<p>Redundant Libraries<br><br>Over the course of many iterations of the system we made a handful-->
                    <!--of changes to improve efficiency. Some of the programs that we phased out over the course of-->
                    <!--the project was the parser for the Interpretation Engine, a Navigation library used during-->
                    <!--early versions of the Set Engine and a neural network that was replaced with a decision tree-->
                    <!--for the Set Engine.</p>-->

                <p>During the development of our system we created several sequence diagrams. We used Creately to create
                    the sequence diagrams.</p>

                        Developer is encouraged to first retrieve the map of the sets so they know which sets they can
                        call (Note that is is optional and recommended). The Front End then calls the Set which follows
                        the same procedure but returns the full set.</p>

                        retrieving all tables from the database it specified to read from. The Set Engine then attempts
                        to generate sets for each table in the database and sub sets using its Decision Tree. The Set
                        Engine immediately pushes sets to the Azure Blob after each set is created. When all tables have
                        been checked the Set Engine pushes a map to the blob that contains the location of each set it
                        has created. The Set Engine then emails the system administrator with details on the latest
