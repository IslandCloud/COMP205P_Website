                <h2>System Architecture</h2>

                <p>
                    The system is comprised of three major components. The REST API, the Chart Engine and the Set
                    Engine.
                    Additionally there are several important subcomponents including general purpose Readers, Writers
                    and a number of helper classes to help facilitate the running of each major component. Data is
                    stored in a blob on Azure.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>The Set Engine<br><br>This program generates sets and writes the sets to the Azure blob. The
                            Set
                            Engine does not need to know the structure of the database in order to generates the sets
                            but splits
                            tables into columns and generates sets based on the column data. The Set Engine should be
                            run
                            automatically a weekly basis using the Windows Task Scheduler to ensure data on the blob is
                            up to date.
                            After
                            every run of the Set Engine results are emailed to whomever the user desires.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The Chart Engine<br><br>The Chart Engine is a general purpose program for generating charts.
                            The idea originally came from the fact that Team 1 were generating the charts based on our
                            data. This can be very slow as we will need to send many sets to Team 1 in order for them to
                            generate charts. If we instead move the Chart Engine to the backend then the charts can be
                            generated much faster because no sets will be required to be sent to the frontend which can
                            be
                            very slow depending on the size of the set.</p>

                        <p>The REST API<br><br>The REST API... </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Supporting Libraries<br><br>During the development of the three programs above we developed
                            several libraries that were regularly used throughout the course of the project. The Blob
                            Reader and Writer classes were the main classes that were used most extensively. Some
                            additional important libraries include a Graph Retriever that is used to link the REST API
                            to the Chart Engine, a database generation tool that we created to generate sample databases
                            and a simple decision tree that we used to classify data types which was needed for the Set
                            Engine.</p>

                    Decision Tree Design: Singleton Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of
                    access to it.
                </h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Singleton</b>
                        <p>There are a number of Singletons throughout our project. One notable pair of singletons is
                            the
                            Set Engine and its Decision Tree.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Model View Controller</b>
                        <p>We have implemented a controller design pattern in the REST API. Different controllers are
                            responsible for controlling the flow of information for different classes of sets.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Fork/Join Pattern</b>
                        <p>The Fork/Join pattern was implemented in the Set Engine. A group of sets created would fork
                            from the main thread then they would each create their own individual subsets. When the
                            forked thread has uploaded its data onto the blob it will join with the main thread and wait
                            for the others to finish.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Test Mode for complex functions</b>
                        <p>Due to the complexity of the Set Engine we encountered some difficulties testing the output.
                            This was because the Set Engine would perform operations such as uploading data into the
                            blob and write emails to staff informing them of the latest run. In order to counteract this
                            we developed a design pattern to run unit tests on complex functions such as the Set
                            Engine.<br><br>We created a Test Mode for the Set Engine. When in Test Mode a separate
                            database for testing will be used. The Set Engine will avoid performing critical functions
                            such as emailing clients. When the data is generated it will then be run against a series of
                            unit tests. The idea is displayed in Figure 4 where the green path is the path taken when in
                            Test Mode. Critical functions are avoided and a test suite is run.

                        <b>Information Chaining</b>
                        <p>One major difficulty faced was retrieving information from Sets. Due to the size of the sets
                            retrieving certain information was computationally expensive and took a long time. As a
                            result we implemented a system of chaining information to retrieve certain attributes about
                            the set without having to perform expensive computations against the entire set. (Figure
                            5)</p>
                        <figure>

                            In the diagram above the "-info" identifier will return certain information regarding the
                            set called "MySet".
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                "-info-size" will return the size of the set.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                "-info-type" will return the type of the set.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        These values are pre-calculated and so there is no need to retrieve the entire set to calculate
                        this information. The information chained can be anything depending on the choice of the developer.

                <p>During the development of our system we created several sequence diagrams. We used Creately to create
                    the sequence diagrams.</p>

                        Developer is encouraged to first retrieve the map of the sets so they know which sets they can
                        call (Note that is is optional and recommended). The Front End then calls the Set which follows
                        the same procedure but returns the full set.</p>

                        to generate sets for each table in the database and sub sets using its Decision Tree. The Set
                        Engine immediately pushes sets to the Azure Blob after each set is created. When all tables have
                        been checked the Set Engine pushes a map to the blob that contains the location of each set it
                        has created. The Set Engine then emails the system administrator with details on the latest
                        run.</p>
