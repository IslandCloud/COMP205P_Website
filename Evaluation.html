                    <h3>Summary of progress</h3><br>
                    <p>We adopted an Agile approach to project development. Each sprint lasted 2 weeks and was
                        synced with each bi-weekly report. The weights indicate the difficulty and importance of the
                        task. We used the Fibonacci numbers to separate the weights. A maximum of three tasks could be
                        assigned the same weight unless there is an exceptionally high number of tasks in the sprint
                        backlog for a given sprint.</p>
                    <h4>Sprint 1</h4>
                    <img src="images/SprintBacklog/Sprint%20backlog-1.png" width="700">

                    <p>As we were adopting an Agile approach to the project we decided to accomplish the most important
                        tasks within the first sprint. This meant creating MVPs of as many 'Must Have' requirements as
                        possible hence the large number of 'Must Have' requirements completed during the first sprint.
                        We managed to complete these tasks on time and evaluate the work for the next sprint.

                    <img src="images/SprintBacklog/Sprint%20backlog-2.png" width="700">

                    <p>During this sprint we aimed to optimise the system as much as possible given the feedback from
                        the client. We also decided to tackle the core problems to make the system to improve the
                        scalability of the system. We made improvements to the core components including the Set Engine,
                        Interpretation Engine and the REST Service.

                    <img src="images/SprintBacklog/Sprint%20backlog-3.png" width="700">

                    <p> Our project workload during the third sprint was less than usual due to Reading week and
                        Scenario
                        Week. We managed to fix the REST endpoints and integrate the Interpretation Engine to read files
                        from the Azure Blob and send these files to Team 1 via the REST API. We also wrote a basic
                        neural network to classify data types which was going to be used for the Set Engine to
                        differentiate sets.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Sprint 4</h4>
                    <img src="images/SprintBacklog/Sprint%20backlog-4.png" width="700">

                    <p>During the fourth sprint we further optimised our system after feedback from the client. We made
                        additional upgrades to the Set Engine with
                        a decision tree to create a greater variety of sets. In a pivot maneuver we made the decision to
                        remove the Interpretation Engine and integrate its parser with the REST service into one system.
                        We decided that it would be more efficient for charts to be created in the backend for the
                        reasons that sets can be loaded almost instantaneously and C# is disproportionately faster than
                        Javascript. To cater to this we created the Chart Engine that generates Chart Objects given a
                        REST request.
                        We also created a new API website.

                    <p>During the fifth sprint we made significant improvements to the blob storage system by upgrading
                        the set engine to produce a more efficient set structure. We suffered a major data loss but
                        managed to restore the data by creating a new database generation tool. We made further
                        improvements to the chart engine improving scalability as well as making significant updates to
                        the REST API including integration of the latest chart engine. We also made a lot of
                        optimisations by testing a variety of methods and choosing the most efficient solutions. We have
                        also explored additional approaches to the permanent storage of sets, and have made progress
                        towards integration with Team 1.

                    <p>
                        For the sixth sprint we focused on the remaining 'Could Have' requirements. Lambros conducted
                        further experiments into alternative solutions while Nathan developed the last features for the
                        Set Engine and developed the project website with Junwen. We also submitted the Web API for
                        the Microsoft Imagine Cup competition.

                            The clients were exceptionally difficult to work with and caused us major set backs
                            throughout
                            the early stages of the project. The team was switched to a new project towards the end of
                            November giving us two weeks to gather new requirements, research and prototyping before the
                            website and video deadline for COMP204P. As a result this left us with a huge backlog of
                            work to do for next term.<br><br>To counteract the massive backlog of work
                            resulting from COMP204P we decided to adopt an Agile approach to developing the system. We
                            could therefore develop the most important features first and iterate towards an optimal
                            feature. We would only conduct further research and prototyping on the features that
                            worked and dropped the features that did not work. This gave us the time we needed to
                            develop the system to its best potential while also conducting the missed out research that
                            would have otherwise happened during Term 1.

                    <p>We analysed the progress of our sprints and noticed that 'Must Have' requirements show up most
                        frequently at the start. Then 'Should Have' requirements start increasing in frequency followed
                        by 'Could Have' requirements. By sprint 5 we had completed most of the 'Must Have' requirements
                        and'Should Have' and 'Could Have' requirements made up circa 85% of our workload. The number of
                        tasks related
                        to the final
                        submission (in green) also started to rise at the start of the fifth sprint and accounted for
                        almost 90% of our workload during the final sprint.

                    <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered
                        alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly
                        believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't
                        anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the
                        Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on
                        the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model
                        sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum
                        is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

                    If we have another six months to development and improve, we will still look into set engine and
                    interpretation engine to improve their efficiency.
                    Since for now, based on our speed tests, it's still not that fast as we expected.
