                        for COMP204P. Based on the
                        information we had from the project brief and information from Team 1. We came up with an idea
                        that uses random samples to generate chart data that would resemble real life data accurately
                        and thus we created the above prototype.</p>

                        On 12 January we were able to meet with the client for the first time since the start of the
                        new project. The developer from
                        SIMS taught us how their current system works. He informed us that their current engine can
                        create sets without knowing the structure of the database but he did not explain how. The key
                        idea we took from the meeting was the idea of sets and so we modified our original prototype for
                        sets instead of random samples.

                        Near to the end of the first sprint we refined our model. We used the Azure blob for set storage
                        and these three components (the Set Engine, Interpretation Engine and REST API) would be the
                        centrepiece of our system. There would be other smaller side features, research and experiments
                        on the side but this would be what we hoped to work towards throughout the project.

                        During the third sprint we decided to remove large parts of the Interpretation Engine and
                        integrate whatever was left into the REST API. We realised that we could just map a request
                        directly to a set without having to do extensive parsing. The mapping and removal of the
                        Integration Engine meant made the system simpler and faster.

                        Near the beginning of March we were experimenting with different ways to generate charts. We
                        figured that Team 1 would be creating Charts on the front end which meant they were calling
                        several sets from our Blob. This meant transporting several sets each containing millions of
                        data points across a TCP stream. To speed this process up we thought that it would be much
                        faster
                        to just create the charts in the backend and send Team 1 a Chart object or even an ND3 Chart
                        object in which they can plot
                        the graph. As a result we added a Chart engine and added features to support line graphs, bar
                        charts and pie charts.
